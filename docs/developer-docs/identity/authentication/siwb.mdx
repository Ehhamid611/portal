# Sign in with Bitcoin

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Bitcoin" ]} />

## Overview

Sign in with Bitcoin (SIWB) is a fork of the [sign in with Ethereum](siwe.mdx) package that enables dapps to provide users with the option to authenticate with their Bitcoin wallet address.

SIWB supports the popular BTC wallets [Wizz](https://wizzwallet.io/) and [Unisat](https://unisat.io/).

### Key features

- Consistent principal generation: Ensures that logging in with a BTC wallet will produce the same principal consistently.

- Session identity uniqueness: Each session identity is specific to the application's context, avoiding cross-app identity exploits.

- Direct BTC-to-principal mapping: Each BTC address has a 1:1 correlation with a principal.

- Timebound sessions: Developers can set session expiration times for control and security enhancement.

- Prebuilt identity provider: A prebuilt canister to integrate into any existing ICP dapp.

## Usage

The SIWB package can be downloaded from its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/ic-siwb.git) which includes an example integration.

To use the example integration, clone the repo, then deploy the included pre-built canisters:

```
git clone https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/ic-siwb.git
cd ic-siwb
dfx start --clean --background
npm install
dfx deploy
```

This example deploys the prebuild `ic_siwb_provider` canister alongside an example `ic_siwb_test_canister`.

:::caution

If you are deploying on a Mac OS X machine and receive an error such as:

```
secp256k1-sys@0.8.1: error: unable to create target: 'No available targets are compatible with triple "wasm32-unknown-unknown"'
error: failed to run custom build command for `secp256k1-sys v0.8.1`
```

This is due to the default Mac OS X clang compiler not supporting compiling to target wasm32-unknown-unknown.

You can remedy this error by installing another compiler using `brew` that does support wasm32-unknown-unknown:

```
brew install llvm
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH" &&  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib" && export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include"
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```
:::


As part of the canisters' deployment, both will require initialization arguments. The first is the `ic_siwb_provider` canister. Before initialization, this canister's ID will be printed on the terminal in a line such as:

```
Installing canisters...
Installing code for canister ic_siwb_provider, with canister ID bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
This canister requires an initialization argument.
```

Copy the canister's ID. Then, configure the initialization arguments as prompted:

- URI: The full URL, such as `http://localhost:3000`.
- Salt: A string used to generate seed that uniquely identifies each user principal.
- Domain: The domain name, such as `localhost`.
- Optional runtime feature enabled: Select yes to enable and no to disable.
- Optional statement: A message presented to the user by the Bitcoin wallet.
- Optional scheme: The scheme used to serve the frontend that uses SIWB. Defaults to "https".
- Optional network: Defaults to the Bitcoin mainnet. 
- Optional session expiration time: Time to live for a session in nanoseconds.
- Optional target: All canisters for which the identity delegation is allowed. Defaults to None.
- Optional sign in expiration time: Time to live for a sign in message in nanoseconds.

An example of the canister's initialization configuration can be found below:

```
(
  record {
    uri = "http://localhost:3000";
    runtime_features = null;
    domain = "localhost";
    statement = null;
    scheme = null;
    salt = "test";
    network = null;
    session_expires_in = null;
    targets = null;
    sign_in_expires_in = null;
  },
)
```

Next, you will need to pass the canister ID for `ic_siwb_provider` to the `ic_siwb_test_canister` as its initialization argument when prompted:

```
Installing code for canister ic_siwb_test_canister, with canister ID bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai
This canister requires an initialization argument.
✔ Enter a text (type :e to use editor) · bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
Sending the following argument:
("bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai")
```

Once both canisters have been installed, initialized, and deployed, you will receive the local URLs for both canisters:

```
URLs:
  Backend canister via Candid interface:
    ic_siwb_provider: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=be2us-64aaa-aaaaa-qaabq-cai&id=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
    ic_siwb_test_canister: http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=be2us-64aaa-aaaaa-qaabq-cai&id=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai
```
