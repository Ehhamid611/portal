# Threshold Schnorr

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Concept"]} />

## Overview

Schnorr signatures are a type of digital signature scheme popularly used amongst blockchain networks because they are efficient, simple, and allow for multi-signatures, threshold signatures, and aggregated signatures to be used on the network. On ICP, threshold Schnorr signatures enable canisters to hold a wider range of digital assets and allow for direct integrations with other chains like Solana.

Specifically, threshold Schnorr signatures on ICP provide:

- Support for BIP-340, which is Bitcoin's variant of Schnorr used in ordinals such as BRC-20.

- Support for Ed25519 signatures, which are used by chains such as Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, and Ripple. Ed25519 is also a popular signature scheme outside of blockchains for Web2 functions such as signing X.509 certificates.

- Provide higher signature throughput than threshold ECDSA signatures.

- Allow canisters to obtain their own Schnorr public key and address, unlocking the ability for them to derive addresses on other chains, then authorize and submit transactions on those chains.

- Enable Schnorr signatures to be computed on arbitrary messages.

## Signing messages and transactions

Threshold Schnorr can be used by making calls to the threshold Schnorr API.
